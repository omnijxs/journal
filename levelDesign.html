            <h2>Level Design</h2>

                <p>
                    <!-- Level design is one of the few things that make me lose the track of time. -->
                    I had been modding games for my own pleasure for years but around 2017 I wanted to dwell deeper into level design.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Between the years 2017-2020 I read - and watched - everything related to level design I could get my hands on. 
                    At the same time, I was constantly building levels and mods for Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim. 
                    I ended up with the total of nine levels in seven mods. 
                </p>            
            
                <p>
                    As of February 2022 these seven mods have been downloaded ~162000 times. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Currently I have no active plans or projects related to level design as I have plenty of other stuff going on in my life.
                    At some point I hope I will have the time to build more levels.
                    Still got plenty of ideas for Skyrim and would love to build levels also for other games. 
                </p>
