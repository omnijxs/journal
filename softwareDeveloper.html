            <h2>Software Developer</h2>

                <div class="intro-entry">

                    <p>
                        I have worked as a fullstack web developer for ~10 years and 
                        have experience from a wide range of domains such as Work Force Management, Games, Internet-of-Things, eLearning and ERP's.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Most of my work I have done with different JavaScript and JVM based technologies. 
                        I would consider my strongest technologies to be Kotlin, Spring Boot, JavaScript, Node.js and React.js.        
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I have worked as a Scrummaster in multiple teams and helped other teams as an Agile Coach. 
                        I consider myself as an expert in Test Driven Development and Clean Code.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I would not characterize myself as a cloud specialist but I have worked with three major cloud service providers:
                        AWS, Azure and Google Cloud. I have most experience with Google Cloud.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In addition to getting better with cloud services, I would want to improve my skills with event driven systems, 
                        cyber security and highly scalable databases. 
                    </p>

                    <p>  
                        The latest technologies I have gotten myself into are Kali Linux, React Native and Electron.js.
                        Next up, I would want to learn Go, Elixir && Phoenix and Unreal Engine.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In my free time I keep myself busy with designing and developing my own games. 
                    </p>
     
                </div>
