            <p>
                I have been a software developer for ~10 years. I would characterize myself as a full stack web developer.<br>

                <!-- I am a hobbyist game designer, level designer and a game developer.<br> -->

                I have worked as a scrummaster in multiple teams and helped other teams as an agile coach.<br>
