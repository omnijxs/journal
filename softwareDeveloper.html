            <h2>Software Developer</h2>

                <div class="intro-entry">

                    <p>
                        I have worked as a fullstack web developer for ~10 years. 
                        I have experience from a wide range of domains such as WFM (Work Force Management), ERP, Games, Internet-of-Things and eLearning.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Most of my work I have done with different JavaScript and JVM based technologies. 
                        I would consider my strongest technologies to be Kotlin, Spring Boot, JavaScript, Node.js and React.js.        
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I have worked as a scrummaster in multiple teams and helped other teams as an Agile Coach. 
                        I consider myself as an expert in Test Driven Development and Clean Code.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I would not characterize myself as a cloud specialist but I have worked with all three major cloud service providers:
                        AWS, Azure and Google Cloud. I have most experience with Google Cloud.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Next up technologies: Go, Elixir && Phoenix, Vue, Unreal Engine </br>
                        Next up theory: event driven architectures, more cloud technologies, more db's
                    </p>

                </div>
