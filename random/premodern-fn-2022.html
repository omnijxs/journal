    <h1 class="entry-title">Premodern Finnish Nationals 2022 - Report</h1>

    <p class="quote centered">(updated 30.5.2022)</p>

    <p>
    I played Pit Rack in the Finnish Premodern Nationals.

    I finished 10th out of 48 contestants with a record of 4-2 (games 10-5).
    </p>

    <h2>Why Pit Rack?</h2>

    <p>
        Pox is one of my pet decks as one of my best friends used to play it in Extented ~1998.
        As I got into Premodern in 2019 Pox was one of the first decks I built. I playtested it a lot, played some casual games
        and one small tournament and really liked playing it.
        However, I felt that it had two weaknesses: 1) it is too slow and 2) It does not give the opponent enough pressure.
        (These two could probably be fixed by sweet-sweet Hymn to Tourach but we don’t have that luxury). <br><br>

        In an attempt to fix these issues, I converted my Pox deck to a Pit Rack with the following changes: <br><br>

        -4 Pox <br>
        -4 Innocent Blood <br>
        -2 Charcoal Diamond <br>
        -2 Infest (Wanted to test these out) <br>
        -2 Stupor (Same as above) <br><br>

        +4 Hypnotic Specters <br>
        +4 Diabolic Edict <br>
        +4 Plague Spitters <br>
        +2 Cabal Therapy <br><br>

        I also rebuild the whole sideboard. This was naturally done the night before the tournament. <br>

    <h2>The Games</h2>

    Disclaimer: I probably have not remembered everything correctly.

    <p>

    <h3>Round 1: U/G Madness (2-0)</h3>

    <p>
    Game 1: In the early game I was on the defense with Duressing/Therapying Circular Logics and Edicting Wild Mongrels.
    Eventually my opponent runs out of steam and I think I grinded the victory with Specter and Rack. WIN. <br><br>

    Game 2: I Wasteland three of my opponents Yavimaya Coast’s early. That’s all I remember from this one. WIN. <br><br>

    </p>

    <h3>Round 2: Stasis (2-0)</h3>

    <p>
    I might have lost one game here but I have no recollection of that. <br><br>

    Game 1: Battle of Black Vise and The Rack as both enter the table early.
        I got some minor disruption but Stasis hits the board around turn four.
        I Wasteland Forbidden City to prevent going to full lock.
        Few turns later my opponent draws his card before paying the upkeep for Stasis.
        I say we can go either way but he says that he has played so long that he should not forget this kind of stuff.
        Quite soon I get Pit on the table and grind out the win. WIN. <br><br>

    Game 2: Once again Stasis hits the table around turn four.
        My opponent, however, lets it die so I suspect he has to have another one in his hand.
        So I go Therapy with Stasis and hit two. I get the engine rolling and grind out the win with Pit and Rack. WIN. <br><br>

    </p>

    <h3>Round 3: PandeBurst (1-2)</h3>

    <p>
    Game 1: Some Spitters and Factories early but my opponent gets two big Saprolings to the table.
        They keep my creatures at peaceful and give me some beating.
        Few turns later my opponent gets the combo pieces where he wants and thats it. LOSE. <br><br>

    Game 2: No recollections of this game. WIN. <br><br>

    Game 3: I got a good start with Pit hitting the table early and some Wasteland action.
        My opponent, however, manages to squeeze out an Intuition and get his combo pieces to the graveyard.
        Next turn, my opponent has four cards in his hand from which he needs to keep City of Traitors and Replenish to go off.
        Dice does not favor me and he goes off. LOSE. <br><br>

    </p>

    <h3>Round 4: UW Standstill (2-1)</h3>

    <p>
    Game 1: Only thing I remember that I made at least three errors early in the game but still managed to win.
        I don’t even remember what errors I made. WIN. <br><br>

    Game 2:  I didn’t really have anything going on and was struggling to get a third land.
        A Ritual-Pit gets a Dismantling Blow. Eventually some cycled soldiers hit the table and my Plagues get countered. LOSE. <br><br>

    Game 3: Don’t remember how the game started but the turning point was when I was able Duress my opponent’s Fact or Fiction as he struggled to draw his fourth land.
        This made him unable to recover his hand. He manages to Stop a Specter and a Mishra but The Rack takes the game home. WIN. <br><br>

        </p>

    <h3>Round 5: The Rock (1-2)</h3>

    <p>
    Game 1: My opponent mulligans to five. I start Ritual-Specter. Turn two Duress and Rack. Turn three Pit and my opponent scoops. WIN. <br><br>

    Game 2: My turn to mulligan to five and I draw just two lands. Get hammered by a Baloth and a Deranged Hermit. LOSE. <br><br>

    Game 3: Neither has to mulligan so we get to play some Magic. Game goes back and
    forth until we end up both with no cards in our hands. My opponent has a Baloth and I have a Specter and two Mishras. <br><br>

    We start exchanging damage with Baloth and Specter and my opponent plays Pernicious Deed.
        I draw Rack but fudge up by not playing it. My idea was to force my opponent to Deed the board after which I would play Rack.
        But my plan had two flaws: I did not have enough to force my opponent to activate the Deed and he has discard in his deck.
        Playing The Rack would have forced my opponent to Deed the board.
        Next turn he draws Duress and Rack goes to grave. I draw Swamps the rest of the game and lose to my eternal nemesis Baloth. LOSE. <br><br>

        </p>

    <h3>Round 6: Angry Hermit (2-0)</h3>

    <p>

    Game 1: I start with Ritual-Specter. Wasteland eats a land and Edict eats a Hermit Druid.
        My opponent has try go off with a Shallow Grave but lacks mana. WIN. <br><br>

    Game 2: I get a really good starting hand: Swamp, 2 * Funeral Charm, Coffin Purge, Diabolic Edict, Duress, Cabal Therapy.
        Next three cards are Swamp, Edict, Rack. I almost fudge up by playing one Charm to empty my opponent’s hand.
        My opponent names Diabolic Edict with his Therapy and I only got one Hermit removal left in my hand.
        Luckily, I draw a Therapy and manage hit two Shallow Graves. WIN. <br><br>

        </p>
    </p>

    <h2>Afterthoughts</h2>

    <p>
    All in all, the deck played really good. <br><br>

    Even the games I lost, all expect one were at least competitive and many of the games I won were quite lopsided.
    I did not face any aggro decks so how the deck plays out against them remains to be seen. <br><br>

    The engine of Specter-Pit-Rack was really strong. Having both Pit and Specter gave the deck enough respectable permanent threats.
    The addition of Cabal Therapy gave the deck speed and late game options especially with Spitters on board. <br><br>

    Otherwise the Spitters were okayish. They didn’t win me any games but that might be due to not facing any aggro deck. <br><br>

    Originally I was hesitant about changing Innocent Bloods to Diabolic Edicts.
    But the Edict was really good and I might even keep them even if go back to creatureless Pox
    Instant speed gives you more flexibility, allows you to kill manlands and gives opportunities to disrupt some combo decks. <br><br>

    Cursed Scrolls were a huge underachiever. I think I did total of 4 damage with them during the whole tournament
    and they felt really slow. This might also be due to not facing and aggros.<br><br>

    For the next iteration of my Pit Rack I will probably go with 4 Cabal Therapies in the main deck and move 2 Cursed Scrolls to the sideboard. <br><br>
