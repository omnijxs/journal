    <h1 class="entry-title">Premodern Finnish Nationals 2022 - Report</h1>

    <p class="quote centered">(updated 30.5.2022)</p>

    <p>
    The Finnish Premodern Nationals were held in Tampere on 28.5.2022.
    I played in the tournament with Pit Rack finishing at 10th place (out of 48) with a record of 4-2 (games 10-5). <br><br>

    Here is a small report of how my games went and some thoughts on the deck itself.
    </p>

    <h2>Why Pit Rack?</h2>

    <p>
        Pox is one of my pet decks as one of my best friends used to play it in Extended around 1998.
        As I got into Premodern in 2019 Pox was one of the first decks I built. <br><br>

        I playtested, played some casual games and participated on one small tournament with Pox.
        I really liked playing it but I felt it had two weaknesses. First of all, it felt too slow and secondly,
        I felt it does not give the opponent enough pressure.

        (These two could probably be fixed by ye-olde Hymn to Tourach but alas, we don’t have that luxury). <br><br>

        In an attempt to fix these issues, I converted my Pox deck to a Pit Rack with the following changes: <br><br>

        -4 Pox <br>
        -4 Innocent Blood <br>
        -2 Charcoal Diamond <br>
        -2 Infest (Wanted to test these out. Didn't do much.) <br>
        -2 Stupor (Same as above) <br><br>

        +4 Hypnotic Specters<br>
        +4 Diabolic Edict <br>
        +4 Plague Spitter <br>
        +2 Cabal Therapy <br><br>

        I also rebuild the whole sideboard. This was naturally done the night before the tournament. <br>

    <h2>The Games</h2>

    <p>
    Disclaimer: The following might contain errors as the human memory is a funny thing.
    </p>

    <p>

    <h3>Round 1: U/G Madness (2-0)</h3>

    <p>
    Game 1: In the early game I was on the defense with Duressing/Therapying Circular Logics and Edicting Wild Mongrels.
    Eventually my opponent runs out of steam and I think I grinded the victory with Specter and Factories. WIN. <br><br>

    Game 2: I Wasteland three of my opponents Yavimaya Coasts early. That’s all I remember from this one. WIN. <br><br>

    </p>

    <h3>Round 2: Stasis (2-0)</h3>

    <p>
    Game 1: Battle of Black Vise and The Rack as both enter the table early.
        I got some minor disruption but Stasis hits the board around turn four.
        I Wasteland a Forsaken City to prevent going full stasis.
        Few turns later my opponent draws his card before paying the upkeep for Stasis.
        I say we can takebacksies but he says that he has played long enough that he should not forget this kind of stuff.
        Thus Stasis dies and soon I get Pit on the table and grind out the win. WIN. <br><br>

    Game 2: Once again Stasis hits the table around turn four.
        My opponent, however, lets it die so I suspect he has to have another one in his hand.
        So I go Therapy with Stasis and hit two. I get the engine rolling and grind out the win with Pit and Rack. WIN. <br><br>

    </p>

    <h3>Round 3: PandeBurst (1-2)</h3>

    <p>
    Game 1: I get some Spitters and Factories out early but my opponent gets two big Saprolings to the table.
        They keep my creatures peaceful and give me some beating.
        Few turns later my opponent gets the combo pieces where he wants them and thats it. LOSE. <br><br>

    Game 2: Only thing I remember about this game is that I Edicted an Arrogant Wurm. WIN. <br><br>

    Game 3: I got a good start with Pit hitting the table early and a Wasteland killing an Ancient Tomb.
        My opponent, however, manages to squeeze out an Intuition and get his combo pieces to the graveyard.
        Next turn, my opponent has four cards in his hand from which he needs to keep City of Traitors and Replenish to go off.
        Dice does not favor me and that's it. LOSE. <br><br>

    </p>

    <h3>Round 4: UW Standstill (2-1)</h3>

    <p>
    Game 1: Only thing I remember that I made at least three errors early in the game but still managed to win.
        I don’t even quite remember what errors I made. Something stupid like playing a first turn Rack instead on Duress. WIN. <br><br>

    Game 2: Both have slow starts and I was struggling to get a third land.
        A Ritual-Pit gets a Dismantling Blow. Eventually some cycled soldiers hit the table and my Plagues get countered. LOSE. <br><br>

    Game 3: Don’t remember how the game started but the turning point was when I was able Duress/Therapy my opponent’s Fact or Fiction as he struggled to draw his fourth land.
        This made him unable to recover his hand. He hangs on by Stopping a Specter and a Mishra but eventually Rack takes the game home. WIN. <br><br>

        </p>

    <h3>Round 5: The Rock (1-2)</h3>

    <p>
    Game 1: My opponent mulligans to five. I start Ritual-Specter. Turn two Duress and Rack. Turn three Pit and my opponent scoops. WIN. <br><br>

    Game 2: My turn to mulligan to five and I draw just two lands. Get hammered by a Baloth and a Deranged Hermit. LOSE. <br><br>

    Game 3: Neither has to mulligan so we get to play some Magic. Game goes back and
    forth until we end up both with no cards in our hands. My opponent has a Baloth and I have a Specter and two Mishras. <br><br>

        My opponent plays Pernicious Deed and we start exchanging damage with Baloth and Specter.
        I draw Rack but fudge up by not playing it. My idea was to force my opponent to Deed the board (minus Baloth of course) after which I would play Rack.
        But my plan had two flaws: I did not have enough pressure to force my opponent to activate the Deed and he has discard in his deck.
        Next turn he draws Duress and Rack goes to grave. I draw Swamps the rest of the game and lose to my eternal nemesis Baloth. LOSE. <br><br>

        </p>

    <h3>Round 6: Angry Hermit (2-0)</h3>

    <p>

    Game 1: I start with Ritual-Specter. Wasteland eats a land and Edict eats a Hermit Druid.
        My opponent has try and go off with a Shallow Grave but lacks mana. WIN. <br><br>

    Game 2: I get a really good start: 2 * Funeral Charm, Coffin Purge, Diabolic Edict, Duress, Cabal Therapy and Swamp.
        Next three cards are Swamp, Edict, Rack. I almost fudge up by playing one Charm to empty my opponent’s hand.
        My opponent names Diabolic Edict with his Therapy and I only got one Hermit removal left in my hand.
        Luckily, I draw a Therapy and manage hit two Shallow Graves. WIN. <br><br>

        </p>
    </p>

    <h2>Afterthoughts</h2>

    <p>
    All in all, the deck played really good. <br><br>

    Even the games I lost, all except one were at least competitive and many of the games I won were quite lopsided.
    I did not face any aggro decks so how the deck plays out against them remains to be seen. <br><br>

    The engine of Specter-Pit-Rack was really strong. Having both Pit and Specter gave the deck enough respectable permanent threats.
    The addition of Cabal Therapy gave the deck speed and late game options especially with Spitters on board. <br><br>

    Otherwise the Spitters were okayish. Having 12 cards in the deck with 3 mana cost was painful at times.
        Spitters didn’t win me any games but that might be due to not facing any aggro deck.
        <br><br>

    Originally I was really hesitant to change Innocent Bloods to Diabolic Edicts.
    But the Edicts were really good and I might even keep them even if go back to creatureless Pox. <br><br>

    Cursed Scrolls were a huge underachiever. I think I did total of 4 damage with them during the whole tournament
    and they felt really slow. This might also be due to not facing any aggros.<br><br>

    For the next iteration I will probably go with 4 Cabal Therapies in the main deck (I sided them to four every single game).
        Will either put 2 Cursed Scrolls to the sideboard or remove 1 Scroll and 1 Spitter from the deck. <br><br>
